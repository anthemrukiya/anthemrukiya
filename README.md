### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Anthem Rukiya J. Wingate. I am a PhD student and a Bioinformatics Software Engineer working as a DevOps Automation Engineer. I am passionate about creating artificaial biofeedback and self-healing systems.  This repository is being used to further my research and development work in the field of Computational Quantum Nanoscience.  Nano-thought-shop is a "Skunkworks" for novel research and development in quantum sensing and quantum computing.  Here I maintain an obsidian vault with a zettelkasten workflow for my dissertation and research,  AI/ML/DL scripting for signal analysis using HPC, and a centralized location for my PHD Curriculum Vitae.

**Languages**: Java, C++, Python, PowerShell, Bash, SQL

**Key Technologies**: Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud, Azure

**Additional Tools**: Matlab, Openlab, SLIMs, Tableau, Obsidian, Antman, Esxi
